## Built In Detroit :heart: Open Source

Welcome to our GitHub organization!

Our mission is to usher in a new era of open and accessible engineering and manufacturing engagement, education and resources.

We believe that the best engagement comes from practical, hands-on and interactive opportunities and projects along with mutual support.

We seek to accomplish this by:

:books: **Publishing written and recorded educational content for beginners that complement physical and virtual workshops.**

:computer: **Building open-source alternatives for foundational engineering and manufacturing technologies.**

:classical_building: **Develop freely-accessible, open technical standards that compete with non-free standards that are effectively proprietary.**

:handshake: **Supporting other nonprofits, professional technical organizations and open-source efforts that overlap with our mission.**
