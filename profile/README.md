# Built In Detroit :heart: Open Source

Welcome to our GitHub organization!

**Our mission is to create open and accessible engineering and manufacturing educational experiences and resources.**

## Who we build for

:white_check_mark: Looking for a future career in designing a factory?

:white_check_mark: Want to know how to design an industrial robot?

:white_check_mark: How to program robots, controllers or machine tools?

:white_check_mark: Maybe you have an idea for a physical product, but do not know how to get started with manufacturing it?

We really want to target people who are interested in the above (and much, much more), but do not have any prior experience at all.

Students in high-school and up should be able to actively participate and learn from our events, workshops and other educational content.

We believe that the best engagement comes from practical, hands-on and interactive opportunities and projects along with mutual support.

## What we are building

:calendar: Hosting educational events and hands-on workshops.

:books: Publishing highly-engaging written content that complements workshops and events.

:computer: Building open-source alternatives for foundational engineering and manufacturing technologies.

:classical_building: Maintaining freely-accessible, open technical standards that compete with non-free standards.

:handshake: Supporting other nonprofits, professional technical organizations and open-source efforts that overlap with our mission.

## Why we build

:muscle: We are passionate about helping create the next generation of creators, engineers, builders and manufacturers.

And we feel that too much engineering and industrial knowledge is locked away behind expensive paywalls and walled gardens.

The industry needs to move past that if we are to tackle the manufacturing [skills gap](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/09/manufacturing-faces-labor-shortage.html) and to build an equitable industry of tomorrow.
